# git-basics

This repository contains a set of lessons on the basics of git, with a focus on the skills, commands, tools, and workflows common to contributing to large open source projects.
So, if you want to get started contributing to open source, want to learn the basics of git, or just want to brush up your skills - welcome! This is the place to start!

The lessons are organized into directories by `XX-lesson-name`, where `XX` is a number. We recommend that you go through the lessons sequentially if you are new to git,
however, for those with more experience you should be fine to jump ahead to whichever lesson interests you.
